## How to clone GIT Repo

### Option 1

- Click on the "Code" button
- Copy the HTTPS link
- On your PC, go to the desired location and right click -> Show more options -> Git Bash Here
- In the command line that opens enter the following command: `$ git clone <Shift + Insert to paste the URL copied on stape 2> `

I've made a short GIF highlighting the steps needed to clone the repo.
Once the cloning steps are done, you can open the project in Intellij.

### Option 2 

- Click on the `Code` button
- Click `Download ZIP`
- Project will be downloaded and you need to un-ZIP it

In this way, the project will no longer be "linked" to the initial project's GIT repo, and you can add it to any of your own repositories.
